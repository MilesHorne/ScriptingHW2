## OpenMP in the above line is a way of creating several 'slave threads' wherein
## your work is split and done concurrently before joining back in master thread
## in FastTree one thread is sufficient, in FastTreeMP more may be needed
# place commands here
FastTree -gtr -nt < alignment_file.fasta > tree_file.tre
# flag gtr specifies the use of 'generalized time-reversible' model
# flag nt indicates the use of a nucleotide alignment 
# < indicates everything to the right is input into the command on the left
# the input file is a .fasta file in wd that contains nucleotide alignments
# > takes the output from the left and sends to the file on the right
# the output file is a .tre file (newick format) in the wd that contains trees
# make script executable by "chmod +x this_script1"
# submit job by "run_script this_script1"
